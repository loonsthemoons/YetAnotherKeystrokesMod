# Yet Another Keystrokes Mod
Hello! 
This mod is a simple Keystrokes Mod, to show the user their WASD, Mouse button inputs, Sneak, Jump or more.
Other features are moving keystrokes, resizing keystrokes, creating and changing profiles and much more! :)
I've created this mod to allow for more customizability in the looks and feels, which not many implementations give the user. 

This Mod is still in the early days, so expect some bugs and jank along the way!

Future features that I want to implement are Mouse Strokes, more robust transparency, better scaling of the UI and many more.

Controls:
- Left click to move a single stroke or a group
  - If left click was not done on a stroke, you can drag your mouse to create a selected area 
- Middle mouse click on a stroke to remove it or on blank space to create one
- Right click to resize strokes
- The default key to open the menu is R
  - pressing that key on a keystroke its menu
- Pressing K disabled / enables Keystrokes
- /profiles for changing profiles


Dependencies:
- Minecraft 1.20.1
- Fabric Loader >=0.15.11
