Hello! 
This mod is a simple Keystrokes Mod, to show the user their WASD, Mouse button inputs, Sneak, Jump or more.
I've created this mod to allow for more customizability in the looks and feels, which not many implementations give the user. 

This Mod is still in the early days, so expect some bugs and jank along the way!

Dependencies:
Minecraft 1.20.1 
Fabric Loader 0.16.14
