# Yet Another Keystrokes Overlay (YAKO)

**YAKO** is a design-focused keystrokes overlay for Minecraft 1.20.1 (Fabric).  
It shows your **WASD**, **mouse buttons**, **sneak**, **jump**, and **sprint** inputs, fully customizable to match your style and layout preferences.

Built with customization in mind â€” tweak how each keystroke looks, feels, and behaves.

##  Future Features

- **Gradient & Rainbow colors:**:
  - Instead of single colors, give your keystrokes gradient or cycling rainbow colors!
- **Keystroke Animations:**
  - Add animations to your Keystrokes, on press, while pressing or on release
- **Add your own Input Types:**
  - Instead of being limited to the existing Input types, add your own to monitor new keys!
- **Scaling:**
  - Currently, the Keystroke menu is placed absolute, however this should be based on your Screen resolution, so that nothing gets cut off
- **Keypress Counter:**
  - Ever wonder how many times you pressed a specific button? With this feature you would have an answer!
