# Yet Another Keystrokes Mod
Hello! 
This mod is a simple Keystrokes Mod, to show the user their WASD, Mouse button inputs, Sneak, Jump or more.
I've created this mod to allow for more customizability in the looks and feels, which not many implementations give the user. 

This Mod is still in the early days, so expect some bugs and jank along the way!

Feature features that I want to implement are Mouse Stroke, Scaling of single strokes and groups, profiles and much more! :)

Controls:
- Left click to move a single stroke or a group
  - If left click was not done on a stroke, you can drag your mouse to create a selected area 
- Middle mouse click on a stroke to remove it or on blank space to create one
- Right click to open the settings for a single stroke


Dependencies:
- Minecraft 1.20.1
- Fabric Loader >=0.15.11
- owo-lib 0.11.2 1.20
